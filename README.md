# Perfect™
### The only perfect, bug-free software in the universe.

After years of research into software development practices, we finally arrived at the first truly perfect piece of software.

## What does it do?

Perfect™ does nothing. **Precisely** nothing. That's how good it is. 

## How does it work?

Imagine the situation: You need to do nothing. **BAM!** Perfect™ does exactly that and not a single thing more.

## Will it work on my computer?

**Perfect™**  works on all operating systems (past and future) due to its insanely modular architecture. It doesn't even need to be installed to work. If you need to do nothing, **Perfect™** is just the thing for you.

## Why did you make this?

Someone was bragging that they write perfect bug-free software and we kinda wanted to one-up them.

## License

GPL, *obviously*.
